A simple hangman game built with Python üêç

**HMG** is my first project I do in Python using sockets, so if you find some error I would appreciate if you let me know through issues tracker.

### Demo

![hmg-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5894606/161370923-3c08ddf4-df0f-43bf-9c2a-f9a656399307.gif)

### Installation

```
$ pip install hmg
```

This installs two execuables. The `hmg-server` and the `hmg-client`. You can check the cli help for more options:

```
$ hmg-server --help
usage: hmg-server [-h] [-H HOST] [-p PORT] [-w WORD]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -H HOST, --host HOST
  -p PORT, --port PORT
  -w WORD, --word WORD  Word to use instead of internet (usefull for testing)

$ hmg-client --help
usage: hmg-client [-h] [-H HOST] [-p PORT] [-c BOARD_CHAR]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -H HOST, --host HOST
  -p PORT, --port PORT
  -c BOARD_CHAR, --board-char BOARD_CHAR
                        Char used for fill board
```

### Running
First run server. Also you can run server on another host, for example in my Raspberry Pi:

```
$ hmg-server --host 0.0.0.0
```

Now start the players in different terminals or computers:

For server executed without `--host` argument, just:
```
$ hmg-client
```

For server executed with `--host` argument:
```
$ hmg-client --host 192.168.1.15
```

The `192.168.1.15` is the RPi IP.

Enjoy üéÆ üéâ !
